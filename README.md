# mark
A re-implementation of bookmark using bubble tea!

## Install

To install, clone the repo and run `go install .` within the directory.
You may have to add `$HOME/go/bin` to your path if you have not yet.
Once complete, you can run `mark` from anywhere.

## Usage

run `mark` anywhere and see a list of bookmarks. You also can (a)dd, (e)dit, or (d)elete 
any of the marks. If you accidentally delete something, hit (u)ndo to add the mark back.

## TODO

- [ ] fix all unit tests
- [ ] max size on titles set (to avoid NLs!)
- [ ] add help menu

## CONTRIBUTING

Opening issues welcome.
